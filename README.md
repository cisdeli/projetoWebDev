## Requirements
The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any new requirements needed by your particular store implementation.
## Project Description
Describe how your project implements the functionality in the requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here.
## Comments About the Code
Any comment you may want to add to help understand your code. This is good programming practice.
## Test Plan
Text describing the tests that will be performed.
If an automatic test tool/framework is used (ex: [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), [jUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/), [Spock](https://spockframework.org/)), the code for the tests can be used.
## Test Results
Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used, its output can be used.
## Build Procedures
A step-by-step guide to run your code.
You should start telling how to install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow these commands (nothing more).
## Problems
List any major problems you had.
## Comments
Any comments you wish to add.
## First milestone - Delete this
You will probably only have material for the first two topics.
But include the other topics, even if you leave them empty, and, if possible, write how you plan to implement them. For instance, for testing, you may say I intend to use the postman to test the back end, etc.
