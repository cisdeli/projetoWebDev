### Project Description
* Our project was designed using bootstrap linked through a CDN and ReactJS, the instalation guide is included in the [Build Procedures](#Build-Procedures) topic.
* All resources used are linked in the footer of every page.
* _Unique Feature_: it is implemented in the Accessories page as a custom shop for collars and tags for your pets. The user can to choose from a variety of pendants and colors. 
* Functionalities added: cart and checkout,  _Unique Feature_ and Login.

### Comments About the Code
* **_public_** folder contains the main html file.
  * _index.html_ were JS is injected.
* **_src_** folder contains all components, images, css and main JS files.
  * _index.js_ sets up react-router-dom and injects the JS code in the _index.html_ file in **_public_** folder.
  * _App.js_ contains the structure of every page, Header, Component and Footer
  * _main.js_ contains all components    
* As mentioned in the [Project Description](#Project-Description), some Functionalities such as ADM and Sign Up logic were not added because there is no backend.
* Some features are outputted through alerts, make sure to keep them enable to get all functionalities.
* Login logic was developed using a mock object. All operations are based on the credential ID. ADM IDs are odd numbers and client ones are even numbers.
* To login use any of the credentials in _src/components/authentication/mockCreds.json_. Feel free to add any more credentials, just make sure to keep them in the same format as the ones already in the file.
* ADM page can be accessed via login by clicking on the ADM name in red.
* Login functionality was implemented only as an example of interation with JS. It is **COMPLETLY NOT SAFE**, please check [Comments](#Comments) session to read more about this.
* Session Storage was used to share data between components (cart, checkout, itemPage, uniqueFeat, grid and login components).
