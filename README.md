# Project Report
## First Milestone
### Requirements
The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any new requirements needed by your particular store implementation.
### Project Description
Describe how your project implements the functionality in the requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here.
## Next Milestones
### Comments About the Code
Any comment you may want to add to help understand your code. This is good programming practice.
### Test Plan
Text describing the tests that will be performed.
If an automatic test tool/framework is used (ex: [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), [jUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/), [Spock](https://spockframework.org/)), the code for the tests can be used.
### Test Results
Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used, its output can be used.
### Build Procedures
A step-by-step guide to run your code.
You should start telling how to install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow these commands (nothing more).
### Problems
List any major problems you had.
### Comments
