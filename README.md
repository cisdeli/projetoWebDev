# Project Report
### Requirements
* README file contains the Project Report and the designated topics for the first milestone.
* Our navigation diagram is included in the [Project Description](#Project-Description) topic.
* The mockup designed covers all major pages: ADM, Home, 3 store categories (Accessories, Cat, Dog), About Us, Login and Sing up.
* Minor pages that weren't designed yet: cart, checkout and _Unique Feature_.
### Project Description
* Our project was designed using bootstrap linked through a CDN so you won't need to download any external frameworks for now.
* All resources used are linked in the footer of every page.
* _Unique Feature_: it will be later implemented in the Accessories page as a custom shop for collars and tags for your pets. The user will be able to choose from a variety of pendants and colors as well as the info contained in the tag. We decided to delay the implementation of this feature so we can use JavaScript in it.
* Functionalities that we pretend to add: logic behind the ADM manage buttons and cart, the _Unique Feature_ and both Login and Sing Up systems.
